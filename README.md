 ### For Booststrap
 
 Botstraps are commonly used on QT Wallets to speed up the syncing specially when first time process.
 
  * Locate your StrongHands Folder and delete everything that's in the folder except for these two files: wallet.dat and shnd.conf or shmn.conf

    If you don't know how to find your StrongHands or StrongHands Masternode Folder, then here's instructions below for both WINDOWS OS and MAC OS:

    <b>A) How to find your StrongHands Folder for WINDOWS OS:</b>
    On your keyboard, press the "WINDOWS" and "R" keys at the same time.
    Then type this:  %appdata%\StrongHands or %appdata%\StrongHandsMasternode
    Then press Enter.
    This will take you directly into your StrongHands Folder.

### IMPORTANT

   * Just substitute the shnd.conf or shmn.conf file for the latest version released in our repository. 
   * The file will be continuing upgraded every week from servers.
